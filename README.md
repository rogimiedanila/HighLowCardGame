"HIGH LOW CARD GAME"

Mina-san konnichiwa! This is an web and mobile application.

For the mobile, I don't have an Android Emulator because the application is
too heavy and my laptop can't handle it, which causes a lagging operation.

But I have an alternate way, which is to make an apk. You can locate it here
"highlowcardgame_pec01act7\build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\HighLowCardGame.apk"

You can modify this code for your future/project purposes. Arigatogozaimashita!

A new Flutter project.
